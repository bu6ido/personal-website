&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome, visitors of my website !!! My name is **Ivailo**. This is my personal website, which consists of three modules - [Blog](/), [Portfolio](/portfolio) and [CV](/about). This website is written in **JavaScript** using the following frameworks and technologies: [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), **Markdown**, etc.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first module of the project ([the Blog](/)) is a standard blog - posts with tags assigned to them, with filtering by tags and simple pagination.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second module of the project ([the Portfolio](/portfolio)) is a portfolio of some projects that I have worked on - the list of projects can be configured via **Markdown** files with a specific structure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third module of this project ([the CV](/about)) is a configurable information about me, created with more specific static Markdown files. The information is dynamic and can be updated without modifying the original code of the page. I just have to add or modify some Markdown files with a specific structure and after rebuilding of the project and redeploying to the server the new informaton will be available in the CV page.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can show an image uploaded to the blog posts directory:
