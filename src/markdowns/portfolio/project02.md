This website is a React application (based on [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) toolchain). It is a web-based client for [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/) API. The design is responsive and based on **Bootstrap**([React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)). This website displays different football statistics. But you have to register an account to get an API token that will be used to retrieve the data.
